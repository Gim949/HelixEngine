###Files:
* *\*.g3db* - Area models. The filename should match the area definition file name in `/assets/area/`
* *\*.blend* - [Blender][1] project files for area models
* *\*.png* - Textures used by the models
* *fbx-to-g3db.sh* - A Bash script which utilizes [fbx-conv][2] utility to convert models from `fbx` format (which is supported by most 3D modelling software) to `g3db` format (which can be read by the engine)
